# React-Web version of initial react-native-app project

The initial project is our final group project for la Capsule coding bootcamp. Our app is connecting wine producers and wine distributors. If you register as a wine distributor : subscribe and start browsing registered wine producers, explore their range of bottles and send them messages. If you register as a wine producer : subscribe and start uploading online your bottles, update your cellar's references and get messages from wine distributors. Cheers :)
